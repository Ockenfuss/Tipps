# Installation
The easiest way is probably the AppImage (https://www.libreoffice.org/download/appimage/). I use the 'Basic Still' Version.
## Uninstall
Libreoffice often comes preinstalled on Ubuntu, but the version in the standard ppa is often outdated. To uninstall, simply call:
```bash
sudo apt remove --purge 'libreoffice*'
sudo apt autoremove
```
